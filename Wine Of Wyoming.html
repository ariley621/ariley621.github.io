<div class="tab"><small>it was</small> a hot afternoon in Wyoming; the mountains were a long way ahead and you could see snow on their tops, but they made no shadow, and in the valley the grain-fields were yellow,
the road was dusty with cars passing, and all the small wooden houses at the edge of town were baking in the sun. There was a tree made shade over Fontan's back porch and I sat there at the table
and Madame Fontan brought up cold beer from the cellar. A motor-car turned off the main road and came up the side road, and stopped beside the house. Two men got out and came in through the gate.
I put the bottles under the table. Madame Fontane stood up.</div>
<div class="tab">"Where's Sam?" one of the men asked at the screen door.</div>
<div class="tab">"He ain't here. He's at the mines."</div>
<div class="tab">"You got some beer?"</div>
<div class="tab">"No. Ain't got no beer. That's the last bottle. All gone."</div>
<div class="tab">"What's he drinking?"</div>
<div class="tab">"That's the last bottle. All gone."</div>
<div class="tab">"Go on, give us some beer. You know me."</div>
<div class="tab">"Ain't got any beer. That's the last bottle. All gone."</div>
<div class="tab">"Come on, let's go some place where we can get some real beer," one of them said, and they went out to the car. One of them walked unsteadily. The motor-car jerked in starting, whirled on the road, and went on and away.</div>
<div class="tab">"Put the beer on the table," Madame Fontane said. "What's the matter, yes, all right. What's the matter? Don't drink off the floor."</div>
<div class="tab">"I didn't know who they were," I said.</div>
<div class="tab">"They're drunk," she said, "That's what makes the trouble. Then they go somewhere else and say they got it here. Maybe they don't even remember." She spoke French, but it was only French occassionally, and there were many English words and some English constructions.</div>

<div class="tab">"I never eat at the hotel. Maybe they eat all right there. Only once in my life I ate at a restaurant in America. You know what they gave me? They gave me pork that was raw!"</div>
<div class="tab">"Really?"</div>
<div class="tab">"I don't lie to you. It was pork that wasn't cooked!

<div class="tab">"Oh my God, I don't know. His wife weighs two hundred twenty-five pounds. She don't work. She don't cook. She gives him <em>beans</em> en <em>can</em>."</div>

<div class="tab">"What's the matter with her?"</div>
<div class="tab">"She reads books all the time. He's a good boy. He works hard. He worked in the mines; now he works on a ranch. He never worked on a ranch before, and the man that owns the ranch said to Fontan that
he never saw anybody work better on that ranch than that boy. Then he comes home and she feeds him nothing."</div>
<div class="tab">"Why doesn't he get a divorce?"</div>

<div class="tab">"He thinks <i>so</i>. When he brought her home I thought I would die. He's such a good boy and works hard all the time and never run around or make any trouble. Then he goes away to work

<div class="tab">"Where's that?"</div>
<div class="tab">"<i>Au show. Moving</i> pictures. All she does is read and go to the show."</div>
<div class="tab">"Have you got any more beer?"</div>
<div class="tab">"My God, yes. Sure. You come and eat with us tonight."</div>
<div class="tab">"All right. What should I bring?"</div>
<div class="tab">"Don't bring anything. Nothing at all. Maybe Fontan will have some of the wine."</div>
<br>
<div>That night I had dinner at Fontan's. We ate in the dining-room and there was a clean tablecloth. We tried the new wine. It was very light and clear and good, and still tasted of the grapes.
At the table there were Fontan and Madame and the little boy, André.</div>
<div class="tab">"What did you do today?" Fontan asked. He was an old man with small mine-tired body, a dropping gray mustache, and bright eyes, and was from the Centre near Saint-Etienne.</div> <!--Map/Wiki-->
<div class="tab">"I worked on my book."</div>
<div class="tab">"Were your books all right?" asked Madame.</div>
<div class="tab">"He means he writes a book like a writer. <a tabindex="0" class ="unindent" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="An author,">Un roman</a>," Fontane explained.</div>
<div class="tab">"Pa, can I go to the show?" André asked.</div>
<div class="tab">"Sure," said Fontan. André turned to me.</div>
<div class="tab">"How old do you think I am? Do you think I look fourteen years old?" He was a thin little boy, but his face looked sixteen.</div>
<div class="tab">"Yes. You look fourteen."</div>
<div class="tab">"When I go to the show, I crouch down like this and try to look small." His voice was very high and miding.
"If I give them a quarter they keep it all right but if I give them only fifteen cents they let me in all right."</div>
<div class="tab">"I only give you fifteen cents, then." said Fontan.</div>
<div class="tab">"No. Give me the whole quarter. I'll get it changed on the way."</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="You have to come right back after the show,">"Il faut revenir tour de suite après le show,"</a> Madame Fontan said.
<div class="tab">"I come right back." André went out the door. The night was cooling outside. He left the door open and a cool breeze came in.</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="Eat!">"Mangez!"</a> said Madame Fontan. "You haven't eaten anything." 
I had eaten two helpings of chicken and French fried potatoes, three ears of sweet corn, some sliced cucumbers, and two helpings of salad.
<div class="tab">"Perhaps he wants some kek," Fontan said.</div>
<div class="tab">"I should have gotten some kek for him," Madam Fontan said. <a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="Eat the cheese. Eat the cream cheese. You've had nothing to eat.">"Mangez du fromage. Mangez du crimcheez. Vous n'avez rien mange.</a> I ought to have gotten kek. Americans always eat kek."</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="But I had a good meal.">"Mais j'ai rudement bien mangé."</a>
<br>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="Eat! You've had nothing to eat.">"Mangez! Vous n'avez rien mangé.</a> Eat it all. We don't save anything. Eat it all up."
<div class="tab">"Eat some more salad," Fontan said.</div>
<div class="tab">"I'll get some more beer," Madame Fontan said. "If you work all day in a book-factory you get hungry."</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="She doesn't understand that you're a writer,">"Elle ne comprend pas que vous êtes écrivain,"</a> Fontan said.
He was a delicate old man who used the slang and knew the popular songs of his period of military service in the end of the 1890's. "He writes the books himself," he explained to Madame.
<div class="tab">"You write the books yourself?" Madame asked.</div>
<div class="tab">"Sometimes."</div>
<div class="tab">"Oh!" she said. "Oh! You write them yourself. Oh! Well, you get hungry if you do that too. <a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="Eat! I'll look for the beer.">Mangez! Je vais chercher de la bière."</a></div>
<div class="tab">We heard her walking on the stairs to the cellar. Fontan smiled at me. He was very tolerant of people who had not his experience and worldly knowledge.</div>
<div class="tab">When André came home from the show we were still sitting in the kitchen and were talking about hunting.</div>
<div class="tab">"Labor <em>day</em> we all went to Clear Creek," Madame said. "Oh, my God, you ought to have been there all right. We all went in the truck. <a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="left" data-content="Everyone went in the truck.">Tout le monde est allé dans le truck.</a><a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="We left on Sunday. It's Charlie's truck."> Nous sommes partis le dimanche. C'est le truck de Charley."</a></div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="We ate, we drank wine, beer and there was also a Frenchman who brought absinthe,">"On a mangé, on a bu du vin, de la bière, et il y avait aussi un français qui apporté de l'absinthe,"</a> Fontan said.
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="A frenchman from California!">"Un français de la Californie!"</a>
<div class="tab">"My God,
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="we sang">nous avons chanté.</a> There's a farmer comes to see what's the matter, and we give him something to drink, and he stayed with us awhile. There was some Italians come too, and they want to stay with us too. We sung a song about the Italians and they don't understand it. They didn't know we didn't want them, but we didn't have nothing to do with them, and after a while they went away."
<div class="tab">"How many fish did you catch?"</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="Very few">"Très peu.</a>  
We went to fish a little while, but then we came back to sing again.
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="We sang, you know">Nous avons chanté, vous savez."</a>
<div class="tab">"In the night," said Madame,
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="all of the women slept in the truck. The men next to the fire.">"toutes les femmes dort dans le truck. Les hommes à côté du feu.</a>
In the night I hear Fontan come to get some more wine, and I tell him, 'Fontan, my God, leave some for tomorrow. Tomorrow they won't have anything to drink, and then they'll be sorry.'"
<br>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="But we drank everything,">"Mais nous avons tout bu,"</a> Fontan said.
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="And the next day there was nothing left.">"Et le lendemain il ne reste rien."</a>
<div class="tab">"What did you do?"</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="We fished in earnest.">"Nous avons pêché sérieusement."</a>
<div class="tab">"Good trout, all right, too. My God, yes. All the same; half-pound one ounce."</div>
<div class="tab">"How big?"</div>
<div class="tab">"Half-pound one ounce. Just right to eat. All the same size; half-pound one ounce."</div>
<div class="tab">"How do you like America?" Fontan asked me.</div>
<div class="tab">"It's my country, you see. So I like it, because it's my country. <a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="But we do not eat very well. Yesteryear, yes. But not now.">Mais on ne mange pas très bien. D'antan, oui. Mais maintenant, no."</a></div>
<div class="tab">"No," said Madame. <a tabindex="0" class="unindent" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="We do not eat well.">"On ne mange pas bien."</a> She shook her head.
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="And also, there are too many Polish. When I was little my mother told me, 'You eat like the Polacks.' I never understood what a Polack was."</a> "Et aussi, il y a trop de Polak.

<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="But now in America I understand. There are too many Polacks. And, my God, they are dirty, the Polacks.">Mais maintenant en Amérique je comprends. Il y a trop de Polack. Et, my God, ils sont sales, les Polacks."</a></div>
<div class="tab">"It is fine for hunting and fishing," I said.</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="Yes, those are the best. Hunting and fishing,">"Oui, Ça c'est le meilleur. La chasse et la pêche,"</a> Fontan said.

<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="It's good, the pump,">"Il est bon, le pump,"</a> Fontan nodded his head.
<br>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="I want to go hunting myself,">"Je veux aller à la chasse moi même,"</a> André said in his high, little boy's voice.
<br>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="You cannot,">"Tu ne peux pas,"</a> Fontan said. He turned to me.

<br>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="I want to go alone,">"Je veux aller tout seul,"</a> André said, very shrill and excited.
<div class="tab">"You can't go," Madame Fontan said. "You are too young."</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="I want to go alone,">"Je veux aller tout seul,"</a> André said shrilly.

<div class="tab">"What are rats d'eau?" I asked.</div>
<div class="tab">"You don't know them? Sure you know them. What they call the muskrats."</div>
<div class="tab">André had brought the twenty-two-calibre rifle out from the cupboard and was holding it in his hands under the light.</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="They are savages,">"Ils sont des sauvages,"</a> Fontan explained.

<div class="tab">"When I'm bigger I'll shoot the muskrats and the jack-rabbits too," he said in English. "One time I went out with papa and he shot a jack-rabbit just a little bit and I shot it and hit it."</div>

<div class="tab">"Yes, all right," Madame Fontan said from the next room. She went downstairs and we heard the stairs creaking. André sat reading in the corner. Fontan and I sat at the table, and he poured the beer from the last bottle into our two glasses, leaving a little in the bottom.</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="It's a good country for hunting,">"C'est un bon pays pour la chasse,"</a> Fontan said.

<div class="tab">Madame Fontan came up the stairs with the beer bottles in her hands. "Il est catholique," she said. "My God, Schmidt est catholique."</div>
<div class="tab">"You think he'll be the President?" Fontan asked.</div>
<div class="tab">"No," I said.</div>
<br>
<div class="tab">The next afternoon I drove out to Fontan's, through the shade of the town, then along the dusty road, turning up the side road and leaving the car beside the fence. It was another hot day. Madame Fontan came to the back door.
She looked like Mrs. Santa Claus, clean and rosy-faced and white-haired, and waddling when she walked.</div>
<div class="tab">"My God, hello," she said. "It's hot, my God." She went back into the house to get some beer. I sat on the back porch and looked through the screen and the leaves of the tree at the heat and, away off, the mountains.
There were furrowed brown mountains, and above them three peaks and a glacier with snow that you could see through the trees. The snow looked very white and pure and unreal. Madame Fontan came out and put down the bottles on the table.</div>
<div class="tab">"What you see out there?"</div>
<div class="tab">"The snow."</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="It's beautiful, the snow.">"C'est joli, la niege."</a>
<div class="tab">"Have a glass, too."</div>
<div class="tab">"All right."</div>
<div class="tab">She sat down on a chair beside me. "Schmidt," she said. "If he's the President, you think we get the wine and beer all right?"</div>
<div class="tab">"Sure, " I said. "Trust Schmidt."</div>
<div class="tab">"Already we paid seven hundred fifty-five dollars in fines when they arrested Fontan. Twice the police arrested us and once the governments. All the money we made all the time Fontan worked in the mines and I did washing. We paid it all. They put Fontan in jail. 
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="He never hurts anyone.">Il n'a jamais fair de mal à personne."</a></div>
<div class="tab">"He's a good man," I said. "It's a crime."</div>
<div class="tab">"We don't charge too much money. The wine one dollar a litre. The beer ten cents a bottle. We never sell the beer before it's good. Lots of places they sell the beer right away when they make it, and then it gives everybody a headache.
What's the matter with that? They put Fontan in jail and they take seven hundred fifty-five dollars."</div>
<div class="tab">"It's wicked," I said. "Where is Fontan?"</div>
<div class="tab">"He stays with the wine. He has to watch it now to catch it just right," she smiled. She did not think about the money any more. 
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="left" data-content="You know, he's crazy for wine.">"Vous savez, il est crazy pour le vin.</a>
Last night he brought a little bit home with him, what you drank, and a little bit of the new. The last new. It ain't ready yet, but he drank a little bit, and this morning he put a little bit in his coffee. 
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="In his coffee, you know! He's crazy for wine! He's like that. His country is like that.">Dans son café, vous savez! Il est crazy pour le vin! Il est comme ça. Son pays est comme ça.</a>
Where I live in the north they don't drink any wine. Everybody drinks beer. By where we lived there was a big brewery right near us.
When I was a little girl I didn't like the smell of the hops in the carts. Nor in the fields.
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="I didn't like the hops.">Je n'aime pas les houblons.</a> No, my God, not a bit.
The man that owns the brewery said to me and my sister to go to the brewery and drink the beer, and then we'd like the hops. That's true. Then we liked them all right. He had them give us the beer. We liked them all right then.
But Fontan, il est crazy pour le vin. One time he killed a jack-rabbit and he wanted me to cook it with a sauce with wine, make a black sauce with wine and butter and mushrooms and onion and everything in it, for the jack.
My God, I make the sauce all right, and he eat it all and said,
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="'The sauce is better than the rabbit.' In his country it's like that.

Il y a beaucoup de gibier et de vin. Moi, j'aime les pommes de terre, le saucisson, et la bière. C'est bon, la bière. C'est très bon pour la santé."</a></div>
<div class="tab">"It's good," I said. "It and wine too."</div>
<div class="tab">"You're like Fontan. But there was a thing here that I never saw. I dont think you've ever seen it either. There were Americans came here and they put whiskey in the beer."</div>
<div class="tab">"No," I said.</div>
<div class="tab">"Oui. My God, yes, that's true.

And afterward they come back and say they want to come again and have another party the next Saturday, and I say no, my God, no! When they came I locked the door."
<br>
<div class="tab">"They're bad when they're drunk."</div>
<div class="tab">"In the winter-time when the boys go to the dance they come in the cars and wait outside and say to Fontan, 'Hey, Sam, sell us a bottle of wine,' or they buy the beer, and then they take the moonshine out of their pockets in a bottle and pour it in the beer and drink it.
My God, that's the first time I ever saw that in my life. They put whiskey in the beer. My God, I don't understand <i>that!</i>""</div>
<div class="tab">"They want to get sick, so they'll know they're drunk."</div>
<div class="tab">"One time a fellow comes here came to me and said he wanted me to cook them a big supper and they drink one two bottles of wine, and their girls come too, and then they go to the dance. All right I said. So I made a big supper, and when they come already they drank a lot.
Then they put the whiskey in the wine. My God, yes. I said to Fontan,
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="'They are going to be sick!' 'Yes,' he said.">'On va être malade!' 'Oui,' il dit.</a> Then these girls were sick, nice girls too, all-right girls. They were sick right at the table.
Fontan tried to take them by the arm and show them where they could be sick all right in the cabinet, but the fellows said no, they were all right right there at the table."</div>
<div class="tab">Fontan had come in. “When they come again I locked the door. ‘No,’ I said. ‘Not for hundredfifty dollars.’ My God, no.”</div>
<div class="tab">"There is a word for such people when they do like that, in French," Fontan said. He stood looking very old and tired from the heat.</div>
<div class="tab">"What?"</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="Swine,">"Cochon,"</a> he said delicately, hesitating to use such a strong word.

<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="It's a very strong word,">C'est un mot très fort,"</a> he apologized,

<br>
<div class="tab">"Cochons," I said. "That's what they are--cochons.
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="Bastards.">Salauds</a>."</div>
<div class="tab">The grossness of the words was distasteful to Fontan. He was glad to speak of something else.</div>
<div><a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="There are very nice people, very sensitive, who also come,">"Il y a des gens très gentils, très sensibles, qui viennent aussi,"</a> he said. "There are officers from the fort. Very nice men. Good fellas. Everybody that was ever in France they want to come and drink wine. They like wine all right."</div>
<div class="tab">"There was one man," Madame Fontan said, "and his wife never lets him get out. So he tells her he's tired, and goes to bed, and when she goes to the show he comes straight down here, sometimes in his pyjamas just with a coat over them. 'Maria, some beer,' he says, 'for God's sake.' He sits in his pyjamas and drinks the beer, and then he goes up to the fort and gets back in bed before his wife comes home from the show."</div>
<a tabindex="0" class="tab" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="He's a native, (trans)">"C'est un original,"</a> Fontan said,
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="but really nice.">"mais vraiment gentil.</a> He's a nice fella."
<div class="tab">"My God, yes, nice fella all right," Madame Fontan said. "He's always in bed when his wife gets back from the show."</div>
<div class="tab">"I have to go away tomorrow," I said. "To the Crow Reservation. We go there for the opening of the prairie-chicken season."</div>
<div class="tab">"Yes? You come back here before you go away. You come back here all right?"</div>
<div class="tab">"Absolutely."</div>
<div class="tab">"Then the wine will be done," Fontan said. "We'll drink a bottle together."</div>
<div class="tab">"Three bottles," Madame Fontan said.</div>
<div class="tab">"I'll be back," I said.</div>
<div class="tab">"We count on you," Fontan said.</div>
<div class="tab">"Good night," I said.</div>
<br>
<div class="tab">We got in early in the afternoon from the shooting-trip. We had been up that morning since five o'clock. The day before we had had good shooting, but that morning, we had not seen a single prairie-chicken.
Riding in the open car, we were very hot and we stopped to eat our lunch out of the sun, under a tree beside the road. The sun was high and the patch of shade was very small. We ate sandwiches and crackers with sandwich filling on them, and were thirsty and tired, and when we finally were out and on the main road back to town.
We came up behind a prairie-dog town and stopped the car to shoot at the prairie-dogs with the pistol. We shot two, but then stopped, because the bullets that missed glanced off the rocks and the dirt, and sung off across the fields, and beyond the fields there were some trees along a watercourse, with a house, and we did not want to get in trouble from stray bullets going toward the house.
So we drove on, and finally were on the road coming down-hill toward the outlying houses of the town. Across the plain we could see the mountains. They were blue that day, and the snow on the high mountains shone like glass.
The summer was ending, but the new snow had not yet come to stay on the high mountains; there was only the old sun-melted snow and the ice, and from a long way away it shone very brightly.</div>
<div class="tab">We wanted something cool and some shade. We were sunburned and our lips blistered from the sun and alkali dust. We turned up the side road to Fontan's, stopped the car outside the house, and went in.
It was cool inside the dining-room. Madame Fontan was alone.</div>
<div class="tab">"Only two bottles beer," she said. "It's all gone. The new is no good yet."</div>
<div class="tab">I gave her some birds. "That's good," she said. "All right. Thanks. That's good." She went out to put the birds away where it was cooler. When we finished the beer I stood up. "We have to go." I said.</div>
<div class="tab">"You come back tonight all right? Fontan he's going to have the wine."</div>
<div class="tab">"We'll come back before we go away."</div>
<div class="tab">"You go away?"</div>
<div class="tab">"Yes. We have to leave in the morning."</div>
<div class="tab">"That's too bad you go away. You come tonight. Fontan will have the wine. We'll make a
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="party">fête</a> before you go."
<div class="tab">"We'll come before we go."</div>
<div class="tab">But that afternoon there were telegrams to send, the car to be gone over--a tire had been cut by a stone and needed vulcanizing--
and, without the car, I walked into the town, doing things that had to be done before we could go.
When it was supper-time I was too tired to go out. We did not want a foreign language. All we wanted was to go early to bed.</div>
<div class="tab">As I lay in bed before I went to sleep, with all the things of the summer piled around ready to be packed, the windows open and the air coming in cool, from the mountains,
I thought it was a shame not to have gone to Fontan's--but in a little while I was asleep.
The next day we were busy all morning packing and ending the summer. We had lunch and were ready to start by two o'clock.</div>
<div class="tab">"We must go and say good-by to the Fontans," I said.</div>
<div class="tab">"Yes, we must."</div>
<div class="tab">"I'm afraid they expected us last night."</div>
<div class="tab">"I suppose we could have gone."</div>
<div class="tab">"I wish we'd gone."</div>
<div class="tab">We said good-by to the man at the desk at the hotel, and to Larry and our other friends in town, and then drove out to Fontan's. Both Monsieur and Madame were there. They were glad to see us. Fontan looked old and tired.</div>
<div class="tab">"We thought you would come last night," Madame Fontan said. "Fontan had three bottles of wine. When you did not come he drank it all up."</div>
<div class="tab">"We can only stay a minute," I said. "We just came to say good-by. We wanted to come last night. We intended to come, but we were too tired after the trip."</div>
<div class="tab">"Go get some wine," Fontan said.</div>
<div class="tab">"There is no wine. You drank it all up."</div>
<div class="tab">Fontan looked very upset.</div>
<div class="tab">"I'll go get some," he said. "I'll just be gone a few minutes. I drank it up last night. We had it for you."</div>
<div class="tab">"I knew you were tired. 'My God', I said, 'they're too tired all right to come,'" Madame Fontan said. "Go get some wine, Fontan."</div>
<div class="tab">"I'll take you in the car," I said.</div>
<div class="tab">"All right," Fontan said. "That way we'll go faster."</div>
<div class="tab">We drove down the road in the motor-car and turned up a side road about a mile away.</div>
<div class="tab">"You'll like that wine," Fontan said. "It's come out well. You can drink it for supper tonight."</div>
<div class="tab">We stopped in front of a frame house. Fontan knocked on the door. There was no answer. We went around to the back. The back door was locked too. There were empty tin cans around the back door. We looked in the window. There was nobody inside. The kitchen was dirty and sloppy, but all the doors and windows were tight shut.</div>
<div class="tab">"That son of a bitch. Where is she gone out?" Fontan said. He was desperate.</div>
<div class="tab">"I know where I can get a key," he said. "You stay here."</div>
<div class="tab">I watched him go down to the next house down the road, knock on the door, talk to the woman who came out, and finally come back. He had a key. We tried it on the front door and the back, but it wouldn't work.</div>
<div class="tab">"That son of a bitch," Fontan said. "She's gone away somewhere."</div>
<div class="tab">Looking through the window I could see where the wine was stored. Close to the window you could smell the inside of the house. It smelled sweet and sickish like an Indian house. Suddenly Fontan took a loose board and commenced digging at the earth beside the back door.</div>
<div class="tab">"I can get in." he said. "Son of a bitch, I can get in."</div>
<div class="tab">There was a man in the back yard of the next house doing something to one of the front wheels of an old Ford.</div>
<div class="tab">"You better not," I said. "That man will see you. He's watching."</div>
<div class="tab">Fontan straightened up. "We'll try the key once more," he said. We tried the key and it did not work. It turned half-way in either direction.</div>
<div class="tab">"We can't get in," I said. "We better go back."</div>
<div class="tab">"I'll dig up the back," Fontan offered.</div>
<div class="tab">"No, I wouldn't let you take the chance."</div>
<div class="tab">"I'll do it."</div>
<div class="tab">"No," I said. "That man would see. Then they would seize it."</div>
<div class="tab">We went out to the car and drove back to Fontan's, stopping on the way to leave the key. Fontan did not say anything but swear in English. He was incoherent and crushed. We went in the house.</div>
<div class="tab">"That son of a bitch!" he said. "We couldn't get the wine. My own wine that I made."</div>
<div class="tab">All the happiness went from Madame Fontan's face. Fontan sat down in a corner with his head in his hands.</div>
<div class="tab">"We must go," I said. "It doesn't make any difference about the wine. You drink to us when we're gone."</div>
<div class="tab">"Where did that crazy go?" Madame Fontan asked.</div>
<div class="tab">"I don't know," Fontan said. "I don't know where she go. Now you go away without any wine."</div>
<div class="tab">"That's all right," I said.</div>
<div class="tab">"That's no good," Madame Fontan said. She shook her head.</div>
<div class="tab">"We have to go," I said. "Good-by and good luck. Thank you for the fine times."</div>
<div class="tab">Fontan shook his head. He was disgraced. Madame Fontan looked sad.</div>
<div class="tab">"Don't feel bad about the wine," I said.</div>
<div class="tab">"He wanted you to drink his wine," Madame Fontan said. "You can come back next year?"</div>
<div class="tab">"No. Maybe the year after."</div>
<div class="tab">"You see?" Fontan said to her.</div>
<div class="tab">"Good-by," I said. "Don't think about the wine. Drink some for us when we're gone." Fontan shook his head. He did not smile. He knew when he was ruined.</div>
<div class="tab">"That son of a bitch," Fontan said to himself.</div>
<div class="tab">"Last night he had three bottles," Madame Fontan said to comfort him. He shook his head.</div>
<div class="tab">"Good-by," he said.</div>
<div class="tab">Madame Fontan had tears in her eyes.</div>
<div class="tab">"Good-by," she said. She felt badly for Fontan.</div>
<div class="tab">"Good-by," we said. We all felt very badly. They stood in the doorway and we got in, and I started the motor. We waved. They stood together sadly on the porch. Fontan looked very old, and Madame Fontan looked sad. She waved to us and Fontan went in the house. We turned up the road.</div>
<div class="tab">"They felt so badly. Fontan felt terribly."</div>
<div class="tab">"We ought to have gone last night."</div>
<div class="tab">"Yes, we ought to have."</div>
<div class="tab">We were through the town and out on the smooth road beyond, with the stubble of grain-fields on each side and the mountains off to the right. It looked like Spain, but it was Wyoming.</div>
<div class="tab">"I hope they have a lot of good luck."</div>
<div class="tab">"They won't," I said, "and Schmidt won't be President either."</div>
<div class="tab">The cement road stopped. The road was gravelled now and we left the plain and started up between two foot-hills; the road in a curve and commencing to climb. The soil of the hills was red, the sage grew in gray clumps, and as the road rose we could see across the hills and away across the plain of the valley to the mountains. They were farther away now and they looked more like Spain than ever. The road curved and climbed again, and ahead there were some grouse dusting in the road. They flew as we came toward them, their wings beating fast, then sailing in long slants, and lit on the hillside below.</div>
<div class="tab">"They are so big and lovely. They're bigger than European partidges."</div>
<div class="tab">"It's a fine country for
<a tabindex="0" class="mid" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="hover focus" data-placement="top" data-content="hunting,">la chasse,</a> Fontan says."</div>
<div class="tab">"And when the chasse is gone?"</div>
<div class="tab">"They'll be dead then."</div>
<div class="tab">"The boy won't."</div>
<div class="tab">"There's nothing to prove he won't be," I said.</div>
<div class="tab">"We ought to have gone last night."</div>
<div class="tab">"Oh, yes," I said. "We ought to have gone."</div>
